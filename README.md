# Students Performance Analysis

This data set consists of the marks secured by the students in various subjects. Here we will try to understand the influence of the parents background, test preparation etc on students performance. Also we will try to analyze is there are any socio-economic pattern that could affect students to perform better on the exam.

This is my very first public notebook data exploration. Please leave comments or suggestions to improve this notebook and give me another insight. Hope you like it ðŸ˜Š

# CLI-based Model Inference
I'm also made a simple CLI-based model inference where you can try to run this model by yourself locally.

![screenshot](./screenshot/ss.png)

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/affand20/students-performance
cd student-performance/deployment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Model Inference
```
python3 cli.py
```

If you're curious of how I created the model, you can take a look at my prediction notebook at `notebook` folders or just click [here](https://github.com/affand20/students-performance/blob/master/notebooks/students-performance-prediction.ipynb)
